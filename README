The GangTella Project
---------------------

Copyright @luk2010, 2014 - 2015
Current build : 0.1.16

GangTella Project is an attempt to build a network based on double connection, i.e. where each clients allocates 2 one-way channels. 
Each connection is secured by two ways : 
- A session-based encryption with public and private key to identify clients. 
- A database encrypted with our random encryption script, gCrypt.

The database is the key of the network : it represents you and every clients you trust, with their known address. As every connection is encrypted, and no critical informations are stored, there are no problems with stocking IP adresses as they can be used by any user, and so can not be used to identify one particular user.

Currently supported platforms : 
* Windows XP/Vista/7/8
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* All Unix-based platforms 
* All Posix-compliant platforms

Libraries needed :
* pthread
* libcrypto (OpenSSL)
* A correct socket implementation (posix or WSA are currently supported).
