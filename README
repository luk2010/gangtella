The GangTella Project
---------------------

Copyright @luk2010, 2014

The GangTella project is a new type of connection, where every connection
have a mirror which pointes directly to the client. These connections are secure, 
and relatively fast. 
It uses the TCP/IP protocol and it creates a higher level protocol with packets. 
Serialization is handled by a minimal code. 

This project can be used to chat with people you like without using any messenger 
or full-of-popup things, you can share files without needing something special.

Currently supported platforms : 
* Windows XP/Vista/7/8
* Linux

Libraries needed :
* pthread
* A correct socket implementation (posix or WSA)
